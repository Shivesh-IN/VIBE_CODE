A simple calculator to calculate your net profit or loss from crypto trades on CoinDCX, specifically tailored for Indian tax regulations.

ðŸŽ¯ The Problem

  Calculating crypto profits in India involves more than just subtracting your buy price from your sell price. You need to account for government taxes like the 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) and other platform trading       fees. This tool automates that process.

-   Profit/Loss Calculation: Calculates your gross profit or loss based on your trade inputs.
-   Automated Tax Deduction: Automatically deducts the 1% TDS on the total sale value, as per Indian government guidelines.
-   Fee Consideration: Allows for the inclusion of other trading fees for a more accurate net calculation.
-   Clear Summary: Provides a clean, easy-to-understand breakdown of your trade.
